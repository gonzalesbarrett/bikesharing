# Bikesharing

## Overview

This Tableau story can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/barrett.gonzales/viz/BikeSharing_16537704123950/BikeSharing).

The purpose of this project was designed to answer the following questions:

Who uses bikeshares?
Where are bikes used the most/least?
When are bikes used the most/least?
How often are bikes used and what demographics?

## Results

This shows the number of bikes rented for a specific length of time. Based on the graph we can see a majority of rentals last between 2 and 10 minutes.

Using a heatmap we can see that the most common rentals are by males between 7am-8am and 4pm-6pm.

![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/gonzalesbarrett/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender.jpg)

This graph shows us that a majority of rentals are completed by males and the average trip duration is just under ten minutes.

This graph provides a breakdown of what time on what day of the week is most popular. Rush hour seems to be the busiest times during the weak and late morning/early afternoon are the weekend peaks.

## Summary

In a major metropolition area like are New York City, the bike sharing program is extremely popular and seems to be an excellent alternative to normal commuting procedures considering morning and afternoon rush hours were peak usage. The user base is primarily male subscribers (repeat users) which provides a steady source of income for the program. There seems to be quite an opportunity to attract female users and covnert to subscribers.

Two additional areas that could benefit from additional analysis:

- Hone in on rush hour starting/ending locations to determine if supply is adequate. 
- Focus more on age groups and determine if this demographic could be capitalized on for non-rush hour users.
